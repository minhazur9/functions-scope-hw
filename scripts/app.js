// Verbal questions
// 1) What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
// 2) Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
// 3) What are the implications of the ability of a function to return a value?

// 1. A parameter is anvariable passed into a function definition. An argument is a variable that is being used to call a function
// 2. A return only passes an output, usually to another function or variable. Console.log just prints out to the console.
// 3. The function being able to return a value gives it the abilty to pass its outputted value as an argument to another function.
